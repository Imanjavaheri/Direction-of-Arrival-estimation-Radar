# Direction-of-Arrival-estimation-Radar
This project focuses on estimating the Direction of Arrival (DoA) and range of targets 
using radar systems. Various scenarios, including a single-target, multi-target, and 
MIMO configurations, are considered. The MATLAB implementation simulates the 
scenarios with theoretical justification.
